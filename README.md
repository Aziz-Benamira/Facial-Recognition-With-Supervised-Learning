### Project Description: Facial Recognition for High-Profile Identification  

This project involves building and evaluating machine learning models for facial recognition, focusing on distinguishing Arnold Schwarzenegger from others using PCA-transformed image data.  

Key Highlights:  
- **Dataset**: Derived from the "Labeled Faces in the Wild" (LFW) dataset, with 40 images of Arnold Schwarzenegger and 150 of other individuals.  
- **Models Explored**: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest.  
- **Pipeline**: Integrated preprocessing (scaling) and model training using `Pipeline` from Scikit-learn.  
- **Optimization**: Hyperparameter tuning via `GridSearchCV` with cross-validation.  
- **Metrics**: Evaluated model accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix visualization.  

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning pipelines, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation for a practical facial recognition task.
